        <p>Where to begin?</p>
<p>An interesting microcosm of human savagery: the eyes of a child simultaneously euphemize and accentuate the horror. Yet, it also attempts to present the way in which humans ‘naturally’ order themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…but the clamor changed from the general wish for a chief to an election by acclaim of Ralph himself. None of the boys could have found good reason for this; what intelligence had been shown was traceable to Piggy while the most obvious leader was Jack. But there was a stillness about Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size, and attractive appearance; and most obscurely, yet most powerfully, there was the conch. The being that had blown that, had sat waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees, was set apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ralph becomes chief not because of any special talent of his, but because he has the conch (a pseudo status symbol).</p>
<p>(there’s an aside one can make here where Ralph, who has responsibility thrust upon him, fares better than Jack who takes it for himself)</p>
<p>To control a population, you must quell the fear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ralph was annoyed and, for the moment, defeated. He felt himself facing something ungraspable. The eyes that looked so intently at him were without humor.</p>
<p>“But there isn’t a beast!”</p>
<p>Something he had not known was there rose in him and compelled him to make the point, loudly and again.</p>
<p>“But I tell you there isn’t a beast!”</p>
<p>The assembly was silent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rules are made to be broken by the powerful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack was the first to make himself heard. He had not got the conch and thus spoke against the rules; but nobody minded.</p>
</blockquote>
Companionship in the face of adversity (as Ralph and Jack face the beast):
<blockquote>
<p>A sound behind him made him turn. Jack was edging along the ledge.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t let you do it on your own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>only to be backstabbed when at peace.</p>
Scapegoat Simon:
<blockquote>
<p>Only the beast lay still, a few yards from the sea. Even in the rain they could see how small a beast it was; and already its blood was staining the sand.</p>
</blockquote>
Subsequent remorse and horror-struck by human nature:
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m frightened. Of us. I want to go home. Oh God, I want to go home.”</p>
<p>- Piggy</p>
</blockquote>
Reaching the point at which not even the death of another human could rekindle the tribal rift:
<blockquote>
<p>The rock struck Piggy a glancing blow from chin to knee; the conch exploded into a thousand white fragments and ceased to exist. Piggy, saying nothing, with no time for even a grunt, traveled through the air sideways from the rock, turning over as he went. The rock bounded twice and was lost in the forest. Piggy fell forty feet and landed on his back across the square red rock in the sea. His head opened and stuff came out and turned red. Piggy’s arms and legs twitched a bit, like a pig’s after it has been killed. Then the sea breathed again in a long, slow sigh, the water boiled white and pink over the rock; and when it went, sucking back again, the body of Piggy was gone.</p>
<p>This time the silence was complete. Ralph’s lips formed a word but no sound came.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jack bounded out from the tribe and began screaming wildly.</p>
<p>“See? See? That’s what you’ll get! I meant that! There isn’t a tribe for you any more! The conch is gone–”</p>
<p>He ran forward, stooping.</p>
<p>“I’m chief!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piggy is written well. The smart fatty who no one respects and who also lacks in charisma, basic social skills, and survivability. He only survives because Ralph finds him useful, and his death comes when Ralph no longer has status.</p>
<p>Good read!</p>
