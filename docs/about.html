            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Yudhi, I’m 17, and I want to make sure Humanity reaches a greater tomorrow.</p>
<p>I graduated high school a year and a half early after realizing the world was a big place, and since then I’ve been interested in AI, physics, hydrogen energy storage, writing, and forecasting.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m doing technical AI alignment research at the Center of Long-Term Risk by leveraging open-source game theory to develop strategies for multi-agent cooperation.</p>
<p>In the past, I gave a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/yudhister_kumar_math_is_art_and_why_it_matters">TEDxTalk</a>, did some <a href="https://github.com/cyclicalreasoning/Maths">math</a>, won an <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/12/emergent-ventures-23rd-cohort.html">Emergent Ventures</a> grant, and attended <a href="https://espr.camp/">ESPR</a> and <a href="https://www.atlasfellowship.org/">Atlas</a>. I love continuity (as opposed to discreteness), riveting conversations, Arch Linux, Argentinian tango, Catholic theology, the intersection of dystopian sci-fi and high fantasy, and absurdly difficult math problems!</p>
<p>Feel free to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cyclic_al">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:cyclicalreasoning2021@gmail.com">email</a> me! I love meeting new people!</p>
