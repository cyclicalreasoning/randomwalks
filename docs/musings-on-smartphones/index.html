        <p>I got my first smartphone on August 16, 2022. I was sixteen, in junior year, and was about to fly five thousand miles to London unsupervised for the first time. My parents decided that being able to call them as a minor in a foreign country finally superseded the risks a smartphone held. So, two days prior to boarding my flight, I walked into Verizon clutching my uncle’s old iPhone 7 and bought my first cellular plan.</p>
<p>Around 95% of American teenagers have a smartphone. Texting has become the status quo medium of communication for anyone older than the age of 10. Friendships live and die by how long you leave someone on <em>Read</em>. Without a phone, your social life is doomed, and you won’t be able to make any friends; <em>Mom, this is why I need a phone right now!</em></p>
<p>Of course, my mother was unmoved by my appeals to normality. While I still believe my arguments were correct, she took a reductive view on the dangers of social media—having a phone is very bad, as phones and other forms of “media” corrupt your mind to leave you as nothing but a screen-addicted zombie constantly walking around with a metal box in your hand (never mind that she did the same).</p>
<p>I thought her claims were idiotic, of course. I had more self control than the average kid, so I could use my phone in moderation. Having a phone would just drastically expand my action space, and the downsides seemed minimal. And so our argument continued for six years, from the day I entered middle school to the day I flew to Europe.</p>
<p>I found various substitutes for phones throughout my childhood: in the thirty-five-minute car drive to school, my twin and I watched anime on our father’s work phone (he complained about his data bill every month), every time I went out with friends, I borrowed their phones to call my parents, and eventually, I registered a Google Voice phone number so I could text and call people from my computer. By the time I got a working smartphone with cellular, I had already found workarounds for the essential functions a phone provided - its main benefit to me was the portable camera.</p>
<p>Not having a phone sucked. Undoubtedly it stunted my social life, and reduced the amount of social interactions I could have by multiple orders of magnitude. Throughout middle school, I had around ~1.5 friends, in part because I was socially awkward but also because they were the only people willing to put up with chatting on a shared google doc at predetermined times. I was excluded from friend group chats that turned into friend groups which persist today. I couldn’t coordinate with other kids to hang out over break, or talk to the cool math kids I met twice a year and lived over two hours away from me.</p>
<p>Yet, credit where credit is due, I did avoid many of the stupid pitfalls that befell my peers. I wasn’t active on social media (though this is changing with Twitter), so I never posted anything that would be criminally embarrassing to my older self. I didn’t get addicted to quick dopamine feedback loops, my attention span wasn’t murdered, and I actually read books. Second-order benefits included discovering parts of the internet that allowed for communication without a phone (Discord) and workarounds to phone verification for accounts.</p>
<p>Moreso, the benefits of not constantly being plugged in became apparent when I finally got a phone. Today, my phone is simultaneously my alarm, music source, camera, book repository, and communication medium, and oftentimes I find myself reaching for my phone subconsciously (or picking it up and forgetting what I wanted to do with it). In this way a phone acts as a shackle: by being the low-cost option for nearly everything it becomes indispensable in the monotony of day to day life. Breaking the shackle requires a dramatic restructuring of the minutiae in your life, a cost nearly no one is willing to bear. And I find dependence of this nature distasteful at best and abhorrent at worst.</p>
<p>The sinful nature of dependence derives from a consistent reduction of one’s action space. Think of all the other things you could be doing instead of browsing r/ApplyingToCollege, or refreshing your Twitter timeline. For an adult, this isn’t that much of an issue. Ostensibly they have a good grasp of what other things they could be doing in the moment and are fine with scrolling through their Instagram feed again (or at least, they should). But for a child, who doesn’t know what else is available, who needs to explore their action space constantly, a phone has the potential to destroy their life. Perhaps not in easily measurable ways: they would still go to school, do their homework, and stay on the rails the system has provided for them. Yet the loss in what they could have done is immense.</p>
<p>The irony here is that, when used right, the internet is easily the greatest tool available to man. It just so happens that its failure modes are much more easily reached by children. Addiction to photo-based social media, accidental wireheading via pornography, and general malaise resulting from wanting nothing more than to sit down at a screen for hours on end. We should be much more wary of these consequences.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wake up and wish I still didn’t have a phone. There’s no chance in hell I’m giving one to my kids (if I have them).</p>
