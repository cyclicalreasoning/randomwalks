        <p>Despite my nearest university being located in excess of fifty miles from my house, I have taken and excelled at pure mathematics university coursework throughout my high school career. The pandemic allowed me to take discrete mathematics at UC Berkeley, upper division linear algebra at UC Riverside, and abstract algebra and real analysis at Stanford by the time I was 16, at which point I graduated my high school two years early to dive deeper into theoretical artificial intelligence research.</p>
<p>This summer, I was a research fellow at the Center on Long-Term Risk focusing on enabling cooperation between superintelligent agents. I leveraged model-theoretic results in provability logic to inform my development of a probabilistic logic in which analogous lemmas held ala Christiano (2012), eventually showcasing the robustness of Lobian-like cooperation firsts developed in Barasz et. al. (2014) to fixed-resource agents with heuristic constraints.</p>
<p>Before this, while still in high school, I wrote, edited, and published an expository paper elucidating the usage of methods from nonstandard analysis in Ramsey theory. Building off of Di Nasso (2017), I presented alternative proofs to the Infnite Ramsey Theorem, Hindman’s Theorem, and Rado’s Theorem featuring hypernatual constructions. Subsequently, I wrote similar papers on the polynomial method in combinatorics (Dvir 2008) and the continuum of differentiable structures in four dimensions (see Taubes 1987, amongst others).</p>
<p>Theoretical AI research is, in some sense, the perfect blend of quantitative and qualitative rigor. One is simultaneously forced to consider specific algorithmic implementations and a grand conception of the ‘space of all possible minds.’ My research had me conceptualizing Kripke frames as possible worlds, which led me down a path hitting on the anthropic principle and why Occam’s Razor was a suitable assumption to build the universal prior on (weight Turing machines by Kolmogorov complexity, Solomonoff 1960). This is what led me to be a Mathematics and Philosophy applicant.</p>
<p>Knowing what ought to be necessitates understanding what is. Understanding what is requires dissecting the intersection of abstraction and reality, methodology and outcome, ideology and truth. The first is a road well traveled – we are all Newton’s disciples, in some sense. Feyerabend’s Against Method opened my eyes to the problem of the second (epistemological anarchy can’t be the only viable option?). And I have assailed the third by inhabiting the proposals of Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em>, Marx’s <em>Kapital</em>, and Yudkowsky’s <em>Sequences</em> (in that order), yet a solution remains inscrutable.</p>
<p>Oxford’s Philosophy seems to be my best shot at resolving these ambiguities. From its loins has sprung the ethical frontier: Parfit’s nonreligious ethics and Carlsmith’s attempts to wrestle infinity come to mind.</p>
