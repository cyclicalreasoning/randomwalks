        <p><em>It’s 2AM before my flight to Istanbul. I open WizzAir’s check-in. It prompts me with my visa number. Panicked, I frantically attempt a route-around—to no avail. Resigned to confinement in the UK, I belatedly click through the Turkish e-visa application. Two minutes later, I’ve checked into my flight.</em></p>
<h1 id="vibes">vibes</h1>
<p>If God requests love, then Allah demands respect.</p>
<p>I have never experienced something quite like being (unbeknownst to others) illictly present in a mosque for <em>maghrib.</em> I pass as Muslim: I’m brown, with long black hair and a beard that implies I’m a decade older than I am. While police in front of the Blue Mosque were shouting at pale-skinned Italian tourists that non-Muslims were barred from entry, I walked straight by with nary a stray glance.</p>
<p>A church has pews; a mosque has rugs. A church has an altar; a mosque has a <em>mihrab.</em> There is no pulpit, no elevation of the imam. There is no color, no asymmetry, no idol to revere. The effigies have truly been expunged. Luther would be proud.</p>
<p>In a church, you kneel. In a mosque, you <em>bow</em>. Prostration occurs not through another (as in Communion) but through oneself. Banker, baker, beggar—all equally supplicant, deferent in the name of Allah.</p>
<p>I knew this. I did not <em>know</em> this. It’s one thing to read the Quran, another thing to practice it, and quite another thing to practice it in Istanbul in perhaps the most majestic mosque ever built.</p>
<p>The Blue Mosque is closed to non-Muslims after 7PM for prayer. I pass as Muslim, so my half-ignorant self decided to walk in (after all, it was my last day in the city). I had never felt such spiritual violation before—but I was the violator.</p>
<p>Islam demands respect in a way I haven’t seen elsewhere. Perhaps this was a consequence of intruding upon a sacred ceremony in arguably the centre of the Islamic world, and certainly the centre of the Islamic Golden Age. I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the food was great! Doner++</p>
<h1 id="eth-conf">eth conf</h1>
<p>DevConnect was underwhelming.</p>
<p>The coworking space was quite good. It was centrally located, near a metro station, with food provided and surrounding restaurants. Bit hard to find anyone to talk to, though. Attending the events themselves was slightly annoying, as you had to get a separate wristband for each event. The satellite events were extremely unattended, and as always, advice for conferences like these is to find friends and/or come with friends.</p>
<p>Progcrypto was overwhelming! 0xparc put on a wonderful event, with accessible workshops, great talks, and even better palate cleansers. Met the Axiom lead and Wei Dai (not that Wei Dai).</p>
<h1 id="maths-communes">maths communes</h1>
<p><a href="https://nesinkoyleri.org/">Nesin Kolyeri</a> is one of a kind. A village in the Anatolian hills dedicated to educating the next generation about the wonders of mathematics. Founded by a prominent Erdogan critic, Ali Nesin, it is run by the people for the people (with a very tasteful library).</p>
<p>0xVillage was an event hosted by the village to bring together researchers working on the cutting edge of cryptographic methods—I went, and had a blast. Learned what fully holomorphic encryption was, how to write ZK circuits in Rust, and figured out that the crypto community had a different ArXiV (e-print).
