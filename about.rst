Hi! I’m Yudhi, I’m 17, and I want to make sure Humanity reaches a greater tomorrow.

I graduated high school a year and a half early after realizing the world was a big place, and since then I’ve been interested in AI, physics, hydrogen energy storage, writing, and forecasting.

Currently, I’m doing technical AI alignment research at the Center of Long-Term Risk by leveraging open-source game theory to develop strategies for multi-agent cooperation.

In the past, I gave a `TEDxTalk <https://www.ted.com/talks/yudhister_kumar_math_is_art_and_why_it_matters>`_, did some `math<https://github.com/cyclicalreasoning/Maths>`_, won an `Emergent Ventures <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/12/emergent-ventures-23rd-cohort.html>`_ grant, and attended `ESPR <https://espr.camp/>`_ and `Atlas <https://www.atlasfellowship.org/>`_. I love continuity (as opposed to discreteness), riveting conversations, Arch Linux, Argentinian tango, Catholic theology, the intersection of dystopian sci-fi and high fantasy, and absurdly difficult math problems!

Feel free to follow me on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/cyclic_al>`_ or `email <mailto:cyclicalreasoning2021@gmail.com>`_ me! I love meeting new people!
